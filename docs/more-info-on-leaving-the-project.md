Due to lack of time and the need to do other things, I had to quit maintaining TypeGen.

Possible Qs and the corresponding As:

Q: Is this forever? Will you come back to this project at some point?\
A: I'm very glad you asked that question! I'm not planning to return to maintaining the project. This may potentially happen, but most likely not in the near future.

Q: What happens with the development of this project?\
A: I've managed to come up with some possible options:
- the project gets a new lead maintainer - if you'd like to become a maintainer, please write to me.
- there's a possibility to fork the repository and create a [NuGet package from the modified source code](https://github.com/jburzynski/TypeGen/blob/master/docs/how-to-create-nuget-from-source.md) and then use it in a custom NuGet feed. This will not help the 'official' package development, but may allow to 'release' an 'unofficial' new version of the package locally (you may also check pull requests to see what has already been implemented).
- I will consider making changes to the project for money - this is an actual option you can use to have some change made, so I thought it may be worth mentioning. However, TypeGen is free to use (it's published under [MIT license](https://github.com/jburzynski/TypeGen/blob/master/LICENSE)).

Q: OMG! The project is DEAD!\
A: Yes, but you can still use the current version - it should work for a lot of cases.

Q: TypeGen's maintainer has left the project after 4 years. TypeLITE's maintainer has also left after 4 years. And in the case of TypeWriter - it's also 4 years. What's the reason for this strangely consistent behaviour?\
A: I haven't noticed it before, but that's interesting. Off the top of my head: aliens.
